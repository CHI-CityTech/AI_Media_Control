## ✅ Requirements

This Python application uses the **OpenAI API**, `tkinter` for GUI, and several image processing libraries. It provides image generation, editing, and layering functionalities using `DALL·E 2`.

---

## 📦 Step 1: Install Python

Ensure that **Python 3.8 or newer** is installed in your system.

To check:

```Terminal
python --version
```

If it's not installed, download it from: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads)

You can use Visual Studio Code as your IDE: [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

---

## 📁 Step 2: Set Up a Project Folder

Create and navigate to a new folder OR Use explorer from your IDE:

```Terminal
mkdir ai-image-editor
cd ai-image-editor
```

Save the script as a file called [Example]:  `app.py`.

---

## 📥 Step 3: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```Terminal
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 🧩 Step 4: Install Required Packages

Run the following to install the dependencies:

```Terminal
pip install openai pillow requests
```

> ⚠️ `tkinter` comes pre-installed with standard Python on most systems. If it’s missing:

* Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
* macOS (w/ Homebrew): `brew install python-tk`

---

## 🔑 Step 5: Set Your OpenAI API Key

* 🔒 **warning** Note

Please Do **not** share your OpenAI API key publicly. Never share the key openly and save the key somewhere. Consider using environment variables - `.env`/`python -m venv venv` file in running the app.

Edit `app.py` and replace this line:

```python
client = OpenAI(api_key="api_key_here")
```

with your OpenAI API key. You can obtain one from here: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

```python
client = OpenAI(api_key="sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
```

You can also set your assistant ID if applicable: You can obtain one from here (Optional): [https://platform.openai.com/assistants](https://platform.openai.com/assistants) 
> If you’re only using image generation/editing, the assistant ID may not be needed. But it can enhance your images with descriptions and instructions of what you want.
```python
assistant_id = "your_assistant_id_here"
```
---

## ▶️ Step 6: Run the Application

From your terminal OR Play the run button from your IDE:

```Terminal
python app.py
```

You’ll see a GUI window titled **“AI Image Generator & Editor”** with three tabs:

* **Image Generator**
* **Image Editor**
* **Image Layering**

---

## 📚 Features

### 1. 🛠️ Image Generator

* Enter a prompt to generate an image with DALL·E 2.
* Save the generated image.

### 2. 🎨 Image Editor

* Upload two images.
* Enter a prompt to combine/edit them via DALL·E.
* Additional tools: resize, rotate, grayscale, sepia.

### 3. 🎭 Image Layering (Mask)

* Use a base image and a mask image.
* Combines them using DALL·E’s mask API.
* Save or preview the result.

---

## 📝 Tips

* Use descriptive prompts for better results (e.g., *"Combine both images with a beach background at sunset."*).
* Ensure both images are valid formats: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`.
