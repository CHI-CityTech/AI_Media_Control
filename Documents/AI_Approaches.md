# **AI Approaches for Investigating QLab Media Control**

1. **Text-to-Image Descriptor Matching (AI-Powered Metadata)**  
   - AI **analyzes and labels** images/videos with **descriptive metadata**.  
   - Media selection is based on **semantic text prompts** matching these descriptions.  

2. **Vector Similarity-Based Retrieval**  
   - AI converts both **text prompts and media assets into vector embeddings**.  
   - Uses **cosine similarity** to find the **closest matching media** based on meaning.  

3. **Direct Text-to-Cue Mapping**  
   - AI **pre-learns direct associations** between **keywords and specific cues**.  
   - Example: "Eerie mood" â†’ Triggers **dark blue lighting + slow-motion video**.  

4. **AI-Generated Media Selection Rules (Machine Learning-Based)**  
   - AI **learns from past user selections and feedback**.  
   - Uses reinforcement learning or decision trees to **predict optimal media choices**.  

5. **Real-Time AI Adaptation Based on Performance Inputs**  
   - AI **analyzes live inputs** (music intensity, gestures, audience reaction).  
   - Dynamically adjusts cue selection based on **sensor or performance data**.  

6. **Hybrid Model: Combining Multiple Techniques**  
   - Uses **text descriptors + vector similarity + feedback learning**.  
   - Optimizes media selection by **combining the strengths of different approaches**.
